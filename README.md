# Rubix Quote Details Page - Redesign

A modern, redesigned Quote Details page for Rubix's B2B e-commerce platform, built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## 🎯 Design Strategy

This redesign implements four key UX improvements:

### 1. **Simplified Information Architecture**
- Clean header section with quote essentials organized in a scannable grid
- Logical content flow: Quote info → Products → Actions/Summary
- Reduced visual noise by consolidating related information into clear sections

### 2. **Unified Action Area**
- Sticky price summary that stays visible during scrolling
- Primary actions (Add to Cart, Quick Order) prominently grouped
- Secondary actions clearly separated but easily accessible
- Sales contact integrated for immediate support

### 3. **Status Communication**
- Single status banner replaces multiple confusing labels
- Color-coded states with clear descriptions of what users can/cannot do
- Contextual actions (Reset, History) embedded in the status area

### 4. **Product Line Optimization**
- Grid-based product cards with optimized information hierarchy
- Visual selection states making selected/unselected products obvious
- Prominent quantity controls for easy modification
- Inline comments displayed when relevant
- Clear pricing structure following eye-scan patterns

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Product Selection**: Select/unselect products with visual feedback
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time price calculations based on selected products
- **Quantity Management**: Intuitive quantity controls with validation
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop (mobile-first approach for future)
- **Status Management**: Different quote states (Ready, Pending, Expired) with appropriate actions
- **Contact Integration**: Direct access to account manager information

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
