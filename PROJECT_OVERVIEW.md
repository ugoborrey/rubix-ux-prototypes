# Rubix UX Prototypes - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Mission

Create a professional internal showcase website for UX prototypes that enables easy stakeholder presentation and feedback collection. The platform should provide both contextual views (with project descriptions) and distraction-free demo views for presentations.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Dual Route System
- **Context Routes**: `/showcase/[prototype-name]` - Full context with descriptions, rationale, and embedded demos
- **Demo Routes**: `/demo/[prototype-name]` - Pure prototype experience, perfect for stakeholder presentations
- **Navigation**: Seamless switching between modes with clear CTAs

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (consistent with existing prototypes)
- **Content**: MDX for project descriptions and documentation
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier, optimized for Next.js)
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment from main branch

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Clean, minimal design** that doesn't compete with prototypes
- **Professional corporate feel** suitable for internal stakeholder presentations
- **Consistent spacing and typography** using Tailwind's design system
- **Subtle branding** that reinforces the Rubix identity

### User Experience
- **Context-first approach**: Always provide project background before diving into demos
- **One-click demo access**: Easy transition to fullscreen prototype view
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works well on all devices for flexible presentation scenarios
- **Fast loading**: Optimized for quick stakeholder reviews

### Navigation Philosophy
- **Intuitive categorization** by user journey phases
- **Search functionality** for quick prototype discovery
- **Status indicators** to show development progress
- **Breadcrumb navigation** for context awareness

## 📋 Prototype Categories

1. **Registration** - User onboarding and account creation flows
2. **Homepage** - Landing page and dashboard designs
3. **Search** - Search interfaces and result layouts
4. **Quotation** - Quote creation, viewing, and management
5. **Cart & Checkout** - Shopping cart and purchase flows
6. **Mobile App** - Mobile-specific interface designs

## 🔧 Content Management

### MDX Structure
Each prototype has an associated MDX file with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Quote Details Redesign"
category: "Quotation"
status: "Ready for Review"
description: "Redesigned quote interface focusing on improved information architecture and user workflows"
tags: ["e-commerce", "b2b", "dashboard"]
created: "2024-01-15"
updated: "2024-01-20"
screenshot: "/screenshots/quote-details.png"
---
```

### Content Sections
- **Problem Statement**: What challenge this prototype addresses
- **Design Decisions**: Key UX/UI choices and rationale
- **User Journey**: How this fits into the broader user experience
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation considerations
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Space for comments and iterations

### Status Levels
- **In Progress**: Actively being developed
- **Ready for Review**: Complete and ready for stakeholder feedback
- **Approved**: Stakeholder-approved design
- **In Development**: Being implemented by engineering
- **Live**: Deployed to production
