# Registration Flow Redesign

## Problem Statement

The current registration process at Rubix can be complex and doesn't adequately differentiate between new discovery clients and existing customers who need web access. This leads to:

- **Confusion for new users** who don't understand the different account types available
- **Friction for existing clients** who need to connect their web access to existing business relationships
- **Poor conversion rates** due to unclear value propositions and complex forms
- **Support burden** from users who can't complete registration successfully

## Design Decisions

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Instead of overwhelming users with all options upfront, we use a step-by-step approach that reveals information contextually as needed.

### 2. Journey Differentiation
The redesign creates two distinct paths:
- **Discovery Journey**: For new potential clients who need immediate catalog access
- **Existing Client Journey**: For established customers connecting their web access

### 3. Value-First Approach
Each path clearly communicates the benefits and evolution possibilities rather than focusing solely on account requirements.

### 4. Enhanced Company Search
Integration with CreditSafe API provides real-time company verification and reduces form friction through intelligent auto-completion.

## Key Features

### Smart Path Selection
- Clear visual differentiation between "first time" and "existing client" options
- Contextual information that helps users self-select the right path
- Smooth transitions with animated reveals to maintain engagement

### Account Type Education
- **Discovery Account**: Immediate access with evolution potential explained
- **Client Account**: Premium benefits clearly highlighted
- Future-focused messaging that positions discovery as a natural starting point

### Company Search & Verification
- Real-time search functionality with department-based filtering  
- Multiple result matching to handle various company name variations
- Clear company information display with SIRET verification
- Fallback options for companies not found in the database

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach ensuring smooth experience across all devices
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## User Journey

### Step 1: Path Selection
1. Welcome screen with clear Rubix branding
2. Central question: "Does your company already work with Rubix?"
3. Two distinct call-to-action buttons with different visual treatments
4. Login link for existing web users

### Step 2a: Discovery Path
1. Company search form with real-time validation
2. Department-based filtering for improved results
3. Company selection from verified results
4. Clear next steps toward account creation

### Step 2b: Existing Client Path
1. Account number input with helpful hints
2. SIRET verification for security
3. Automatic account linkage validation
4. Streamlined access to existing benefits

## Technical Implementation

### React Architecture
- Modular component design with clear separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for search functionality and form management
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety and developer experience

### State Management
- Local state for form data and search results
- Efficient re-rendering with useCallback optimization
- Progressive form validation with clear error states

### API Integration
- Mock CreditSafe integration for company search
- Debounced search to optimize API calls
- Error handling for network issues and API failures

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation throughout the flow
- High contrast color schemes for visual accessibility
